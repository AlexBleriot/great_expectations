### 4. Copy existing Expectation JSON files to the S3 bucket (This step is optional)
-->

If you are converting an existing local Great Expectations deployment to one that works in AWS you may already have Expectations saved that you wish to keep and transfer to your S3 bucket.

One way to copy Expectations into Amazon S3 is by using the ``aws s3 sync`` command.  As mentioned earlier, the ``base_directory`` is set to ``expectations/`` by default.

```bash title="Terminal command"
aws s3 sync '<base_directory>' s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```
In the example below, two Expectations, ``exp1`` and ``exp2`` are copied to Amazon S3.  This results in the following output:

```bash title="Terminal output"
upload: ./exp1.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/exp1.json
upload: ./exp2.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/exp2.json
```

If you have Expectations to copy into S3, your output should look similar.
