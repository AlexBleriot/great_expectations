### 2. Configure your bucket policy to enable appropriate access
-->

The example policy below **enforces IP-based access** - modify the bucket name and IP addresses for your situation. After you have customized the example policy to suit your situation, save it to a file called ``ip-policy.json`` in your local directory.

:::important

Your policy should provide access only to appropriate users. Data Docs sites can include critical information about raw data and should generally **not** be publicly accessible.

```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Sid": "Allow only based on source IP",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::data-docs.my_org",
        "arn:aws:s3:::data-docs.my_org/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": [
            "192.168.0.1/32",
            "2001:db8:1234:1234::/64"
