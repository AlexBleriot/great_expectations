# Slack Guidelines:

## Be Nice. Be Respectful.
We cannot stress enough that we want this to be a safe, comfortable and inclusive environment. Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if you need more information on this guideline.

## Keep timezones in mind and be respectful of peoples’ time.
People on Slack are distributed and might be in a very different time zone from you, so don't use @channel @here (this is reserved for admins anyways). Before you @-mention someone, think about what timezone they are in and if you are likely to disturb them. You can check someone's timezone in their profile. As of today, the core GX team is based solely in the United States but the community is world wide.

For example: if you post a question during a weekday US evening (12:00AM-11:00AM GMT), it could take some time until you receive a reply from our team. If you post a question on a Friday evening or before a US Holiday, it could be 3-4 days until one of our team members sees your question. In any event we ask for your patience and bear in mind other community members might be able to help.

## Asking for help

- Do your best to try and solve the problem first as your efforts will help us more easily answer the question.
- [Read "How to write a good question in Slack"](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/discussions/4951)
- Head over to our [Documentation](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/)
- Checkout [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/discussions) this is where we want most of our problem solving, discussion, updates, etc to go because it helps keep a more visible record for GX users.

#### Asking your question in Slack

**Know your support channel:**
<ul>
	<li>#community-help: Having trouble with customizing your Expectations, an integration or anything else .beyond just getting started? Post here.</li>
	<li>#feature-requests: Have a good idea for an Expectation or a feature? Post it here. </li>
	<li>#contributing: For previous, current and prospective contributors to talk about potential contributions and to help each other with contributions.</li>
</ul>
## Use Public Channels, Not Private Groups or Private Messages
Slack is about communication, so use public channels whenever possible. This is good for transparency, but also keeps the community vibrant and alive. You also have an opportunity to help someone else who might find your conversation helpful or encouraging. We discourage the use of Direct Messaging to our staff for the sake of seeking support. Please use the public channels. If you believe your questions has not gotten attention, either ask the question again or re-share the question to the same channel.

## Avoid Posting Same Question In Multiple Channels
Please see the list of community support channels above (or other appropriate channels below). If you are unsure where to ask, please post in #community-help and worst-scase scenario a team member will move it to the correct channel. Posting the same question to two or more channels will not get your question asked any faster and duplicate questions will be deleted by our team.


## Promoting Products or Services
Great Expectations is a piece of the puzzle when it comes to being a data practitioner and so we want our community to be aware of the other pieces that make up the whole picture. If you plan on sharing an awesome tool or service you have no association with jump into #tools_and_services. If you are promoting your own please abide by the following rules.

1. You're allowed to;
    1. Promote your tool ONLY in #tool_and_service or when you introduce yourself in #introductions.
    2. Promote your tool in the tools channel once. Beyond answering questions about the tool multiple postings may be viewed as excessive and receive a warning.
    3. Mention your tool if someone mentions or is organic to a solution.
2. If you see a partnership opportunity with Great Expectations please DM Ruben Orduz Eaton or Kyle Eaton. We would love to create collaborative content and work with you if possible in promoting your product/service. 
3. We will warn you if your promotion becomes excessive or not aligned with our code of conduct. If continued the result could end in you being removed from the slack community.
4. **No Soliciting. Do not cold DM our users to promote your product. If we receive a valid soliciting complaint about you, we will remove you from the community. 
5. Have any questions about our promotional rules or want to run what you plan to share by us? DM Ruben Orduz or Kyle Eaton
